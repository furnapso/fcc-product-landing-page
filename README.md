# Free Code Camp: Responsive Web Design
## Project 3: Build a Product Landing Page

**Objective**: Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

### Thoughts
I couldn't find the kind of logo that I was afer, so I spent a few minutes reading through the Inkscape tutorial and whipped one up myself. 

I am making my way through **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** which is an amazing free resource for people starting on their web developer journey.
